Machine Learning approaches provides a set of tool that can improve drug discovery and decision making for well defined questions with abundant, high quality data. 
Interpretation of model wil allow us to understand, How we can design a better drug. 
### Machine learning is a working horse of modern drug discovery and has been ever since the early days of QSAR.

# DATA COLLECTION 

The data have been taken from chEMBL(ChEMBL is a manually curated database of bioactive molecules with drug-like properties. It brings together chemical, bioactivity and genomic data to aid the translation of genomic information into effective new drugs) using chembl_webresource_client library. The library is developed and supported by chEMBL group. The library help accessing chEMBL data.

##### Here is a flowchart for dataset preparation :-
